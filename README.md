## Old Versions of the Course 

* The Spring 2023 version of the course can be accessed by clicking on the tag titled [spring2022](https://github.com/fmegahed/isa444/releases/tag/spring2023).


 ## Acknowledgments
* The organization of the course is inspired by [Dr. Allison Jones-Farmer](https://miamioh.edu/fsb/directory/?up=/directory/farmerl2)'s teaching of the class in Spring 2020. I am extremely thankful that she was willing to share her course materials with me. I have learned a lot from how she set up her course and for her vision for [this undergraduate course](https://bulletin.miamioh.edu/search/?P=ISA%20444).  
* In our course, we are using the [Principles of Business Forecasting Book by Ord, Fildes & Kourentzes](https://wessexlearning.com/products/principles-of-business-forecasting-2nd-ed). Therefore, the structure of my lecture notes follows the material in the book (but in many cases with updated examples and additional details based on my research and/or the excellent material created by [Dr. Allison Jones-Farmer](https://miamioh.edu/fsb/directory/?up=/directory/farmerl2).
